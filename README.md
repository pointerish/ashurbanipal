# Ashurbanipal

[Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal) is an aggregator API that serves Hacker News' top 50 stories. It is built using Elixir/OTP and without using [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) or a database to store data. It uses ETS to store Hacker News' stories in memory.

It was named after the last great Assyrian king who was fond of collection clay tablets in his library. He is the reason why we still have the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh).
